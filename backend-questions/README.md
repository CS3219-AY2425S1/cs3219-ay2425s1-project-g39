# Backend Guide

This document serves as a simple guide to our backend system.

## Setting Up

1) Create a config.env file, which should include:

2) Ensure that MongoDB Cloud allows your IP address.

## Background

The MongoDB set up was based on [this](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/v4.1/quick-start/) tutorial by MongoDB
