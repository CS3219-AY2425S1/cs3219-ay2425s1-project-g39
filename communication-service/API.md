# API Documentation for Communication Service

## Overview

This API documentation describes the WebSocket-based communication service for real-time features in our application, including user authentication, room management, and messaging functionalities using Socket.IO. 

The main functionality of this service is to provide a chatbox and video call between pairs of users.

## Security

This server can be ran on HTTPS, where clients will have to use the right protocols.

The client will require a valid JWT created from our user service to connect to our server.

## Base URL

```
wss://<your-server-address>/api/comm/socket.io
```

## WebSocket Events

### 1. `connect`

- **Description**: Triggered when a client successfully connects to the Socket.IO server.
- **Parameters**: None.
- **Response**: A confirmation message that the client is connected.

### 2. `disconnect`

- **Description**: Triggered when a client disconnects from the Socket.IO server.
- **Parameters**: None.
- **Response**: Notification to the server indicating that the user has disconnected.

### 3. `joinRoom`

- **Description**: Allows a user to join a specified room for communication.
- **Parameters**:
  - `roomId` (string): The ID of the room the user wants to join.
- **Emitted From**: Client.
- **Response**:
  - On success: The server emits `roomJoined` with the `roomId`.
  - On failure: The server emits `error` if the room is full or the roomId is invalid.

**Example Request**:

```javascript
socket.emit('joinRoom', 'roomId123');
```

**Example Response**:

```javascript
socket.on('roomJoined', (roomId) => {
  console.log(`Joined room: ${roomId}`);
});
```

### 4. `offer`

- **Description**: Sends a WebRTC offer to another user in the room.
- **Parameters**:
  - `offer` (RTCSessionDescription): The WebRTC offer.
- **Emitted From**: Client.
- **Response**: The server broadcasts the `offer` to all other users in the same room.

**Example Request**:

```javascript
socket.emit('offer', offer);
```

### 5. `answer`

- **Description**: Sends a WebRTC answer in response to an offer.
- **Parameters**:
  - `answer` (RTCSessionDescription): The WebRTC answer.
- **Emitted From**: Client.
- **Response**: The server broadcasts the `answer` to the user who sent the original offer.

**Example Request**:

```javascript
socket.emit('answer', answer);
```

### 6. `candidate`

- **Description**: Sends an ICE candidate to facilitate peer-to-peer connection.
- **Parameters**:
  - `candidate` (RTCIceCandidate): The ICE candidate object.
- **Emitted From**: Client.
- **Response**: The server broadcasts the `candidate` to all other users in the room.

**Example Request**:

```javascript
socket.emit('candidate', candidate);
```

### 7. `chatMessage`

- **Description**: Sends a chat message to users in the room.
- **Parameters**:
  - `msg` (object): The message object containing:
    - `body` (string): The content of the message.
- **Emitted From**: Client.
- **Response**: The server attaches the username of the sender, then broadcasts the message to all users in the room, including the original sender.

**Example Request**:

```javascript
const msg = { body: 'Hello everyone!'};
socket.emit('chatMessage', msg);
```

**Example Response**:

```javascript
socket.on('chatMessage', (msg) => {
  console.log(`${msg.username}: ${msg.body}`);
});
```

### 8. `error`

- **Description**: Used for error handling in socket communication.
- **Parameters**:
  - `message` (string): Error message describing the issue.
- **Response**: The client can listen for this event to handle errors gracefully.

**Example Response**:

```javascript
socket.on('error', (error) => {
  alert(`Error: ${error}`);
});
```

### 9. `user-joined`

- **Description**: Notification that a new user has joined the room.
- **Parameters**:
  - `userId` (string): The ID of the user who joined.
- **Response**: The server broadcasts this message to all users in the room.

**Example Response**:

```javascript
socket.on('user-joined', (userId) => {
  console.log(`User ${userId} has joined the room.`);
});
```

### 10. `user-left`

- **Description**: Notification that a user has left the room.
- **Parameters**:
  - `userId` (string): The ID of the user who left.
- **Response**: The server broadcasts this message to all users in the room.

**Example Response**:

```javascript
socket.on('user-left', (userId) => {
  console.log(`User ${userId} has left the room.`);
});
```

## Authentication Middleware

The Socket.IO server uses JWT tokens for authentication. When a user attempts to connect, the token should be included in the `authorization` header.

**Example**:

```javascript
const socket = io('https://localhost:9999', {
  path: '/api/comm/socket.io',
  extraHeaders: {
    Authorization: `Bearer fooBar`
  }
});
```

### Authentication Error Handling

If authentication fails, the server will emit an `error` event to the client, before disconnecting the client automatically.
