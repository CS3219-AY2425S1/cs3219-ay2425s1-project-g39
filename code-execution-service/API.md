      }
      ```

### Example Response for Erroneous Code

#### Request

```json
{
  "code": "num1 = int(input())\nnum2 = int(input())\nsum_result = myMistake + num2\nprint(f'The sum is: {sum_result}')",
  "language": "python",
  "input": "20\n30"
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
    "output": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/tempCode.py\", line 3, in <module>\n    sum_result = myMistake + num2\n                 ^^^^^^^^^\nNameError: name 'myMistake' is not defined\n",
    "is_error": true
}
```

## Error Handling

- If the provided language is unsupported, a `400` error with the message `"Unsupported language."` is returned.
- Errors encountered during execution (e.g., syntax errors) are returned in the `200` normal response, with `is_error` set to `true`.
- Any unknown errors are logged on the server and return a generic error message to the client.

## Important Notes

1. **File Cleanup**: Temporary files created for code execution are deleted after the process to prevent storage accumulation.

## Additional Information

This service is designed to handle single file execution only and will require modifications for handling multi-file dependencies or projects.
